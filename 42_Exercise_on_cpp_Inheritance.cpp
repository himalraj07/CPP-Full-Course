*/
// Solve these Questions:
/*
    Create 2 classes:
    1.SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the reasults using another function
    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility functon and performs any four scientific operation of your choice and displays the reasults using another function.

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes:
    Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using?
    Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using?
    Q3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display reasults of simple and scientific calculator.
    Q4. How is code reusability implemented?
