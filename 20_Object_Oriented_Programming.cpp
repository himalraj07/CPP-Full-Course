    20. Object Oriented Programming in C++
*/

/*
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and manipulate data and behaviors. C++ is a powerful programming language that supports object-oriented programming. In this paradigm, you can define classes, create objects based on those classes, and interact with them using member functions and data members.

    Here's a brief overview of key concepts and features related to object-oriented programming in C++:

    1. Classes: A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions into a single unit. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects. Classes can have data members (attributes) and member functions (methods) that define their behavior.

    2. Objects: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own set of data and behavior. You can create multiple objects from a single class, and each object operates independently.

    3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and related functions into a single unit (class). It hides the internal implementation details of the class and provides access to data through member functions. This helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding.

    4. Inheritance: Inheritance allows you to create new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). Derived classes inherit the properties (data and member functions) of the base class, which promotes code reuse and supports the "is-a" relationship. C++ supports single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance.

    5. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types through inheritance and virtual functions. Polymorphism can be achieved through function overloading and function overriding.

    6. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. In C++, you can create abstract classes that cannot be instantiated directly but can be used as base classes for derived classes. Abstract classes may contain pure virtual functions, which must be implemented by derived classes.

    7. Constructors and Destructors: Constructors are special member functions that are called automatically when an object is created. They initialize the object's data members. Destructors are special member functions that are called automatically when an object is destroyed. They clean up any resources allocated by the object.

    These concepts form the foundation of object-oriented programming in C++. By utilizing them effectively, you can write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
