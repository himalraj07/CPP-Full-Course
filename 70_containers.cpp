    70. Containers in C++ STL
*/

/*
    There are 3 types of containers
    1. Sequence Containers      --> Linear Pattern (Vector, List, Dequeue)
    2. Associative Containers   --> Direct Accessible, Stores data in tree like structure (Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap)
    3. Derived Containers       --> Real world modeling (Stack, Queue, Priority-Queue)
*/

/*
    When to use ?

    # Sequence Containers
    1. Vector --> Random Access = Fast (Compared to array)
    Insertion/Deletion at the Medium = slow
    Insertion/Deletion at the end = Fast

    2. List --> Random Access = Slow
    Middle Insertion = Fast
    Deletion/Insertion at the end = fast

    # Associative Containers
    All operations Fast except Random Access

    # Derived Containers
    Depends --> Data Structure
